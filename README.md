Hi! I love notion and because of Covid a lot of my work is now at discord. So I though that it would be amazing if existed a discord bot that could integrate **notion** and **discord** in a way that if a task is attached to you in your notion work page discord would notify you in some page on your discord work server.

Therefore, I'm trying to create this bot with 2 python libs:
- [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [notion-py](https://pypi.org/project/notion-py/)
